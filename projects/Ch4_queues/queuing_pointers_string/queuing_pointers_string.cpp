/***************************** Important Notes *****************************
 * 1) Notice how queue functions will always work with the address of the
 *    data being worked with. This is a gotcha, as not referencing '&'
 *    correctly will cause the code to not work. 
 * 
 *    In this case, notice how strings to queues are sent by sending
 *    the address of the pointer that points to the buffer
 *    a.k.a a pointer to a pointer
